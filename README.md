E-Wallet — Java, Sring Boot, MySQL, Kafka link
• Design the application using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
Break down the functionality into individual microservices, such as user management, wallet management,
transaction processing, and notification services. Each microservice should be developed using Spring Boot,
with Hibernate for data persistence, and exposed through RESTful APIs for communication between services.
Use MySQL as the database for storing user and transaction data. Kafka can be utilized for asynchronous
communication and event sourcing between microservices, helping to ensure data consistency and real-time
updates.
